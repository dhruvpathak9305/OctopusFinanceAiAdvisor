## 🧪 Test Results

### **Test 1: ICICI Bank (October 2025)**

**Query Result:**
```
Transaction                      Type      Amount     Treatment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Apple Services Subscription     expense   ₹179       Count in Expenses
PolicyBazaar Insurance Payment  expense   ₹1,890     Count in Expenses
Transfer to HDFC Bank           transfer  ₹50,000    🔄 EXCLUDED from totals
Transfer to Axis Bank           transfer  ₹50,000    🔄 EXCLUDED from totals
Apple Services Subscription     expense   ₹319       Count in Expenses
Transfer to Axis Bank           transfer  ₹6,808     🔄 EXCLUDED from totals
```

**Expected Summary Cards:**
```
Income:    +₹0           (no income transactions)
Expenses:  -₹2,388       (₹179 + ₹1,890 + ₹319)
Net:       -₹2,388       (₹0 - ₹2,388)

🔄 3 transfer(s) excluded from totals
```

**✅ Verified:**
- 6 transactions shown (3 expenses + 3 transfers)
- 3 transfers visible but excluded from totals
- Only true expenses counted (₹2,388)

### **Test 2: IDFC FIRST Bank (September 2025)**

**Query Result (Incoming Transfers):**
```
Transaction              Type      Amount     Match Type
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Transfer to IDFC FIRST  transfer  ₹50,000    ✅ Destination (Incoming)
Transfer to IDFC FIRST  transfer  ₹48,000    ✅ Destination (Incoming)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Both incoming transfers from ICICI should appear in IDFC's transaction list
- ✅ Both should be marked as 🔄 EXCLUDED from totals
- ✅ Should NOT be counted in Income (even though money came in)
- ✅ Should show "🔄 2 transfer(s) excluded from totals"

**Full IDFC Transaction List (September 2025):**
```
Regular Transactions:
- Multiple expenses (Burger King, Cab payments, etc.)
- Some income (dividends, payments)

+ Incoming Transfers:
- ₹50,000 from ICICI (Sep 8) ← NEW! Now visible
- ₹48,000 from ICICI (Sep 8) ← NEW! Now visible
```

**Summary Cards Should Show:**
```
Income:    +₹X (only true income, NOT including ₹98,000 transfers)
Expenses:  -₹Y (only true expenses)
Net:       Income - Expenses

🔄 2 transfer(s) excluded from totals
```

---

### **Test 3: Account Filtering Logic**

**For any Account X:**

**Transactions Shown:**
```sql
WHERE (
  source_account_id = X                              -- All outgoing
  OR (type = 'transfer' AND destination_account_id = X)  -- Incoming transfers
)
```

**Summary Calculation:**
```sql
Income = SUM(amount) WHERE type = 'income' AND source_account_id = X
Expenses = SUM(amount) WHERE type = 'expense' AND source_account_id = X
Net = Income - Expenses

-- Transfers are shown but NOT included in either total
```
