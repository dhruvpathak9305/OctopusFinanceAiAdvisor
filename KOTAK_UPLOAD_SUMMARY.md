## 💡 Key Observations

### Auto-Sweep Pattern Discovery
Your Kotak account demonstrates a sophisticated auto-sweep facility:
1. FD matures → credited to savings (e.g., ₹522,433)
2. Next day → excess swept to new FD (e.g., ₹500,000)
3. Maintains optimal balance (~₹50K)
4. Automatic re-investment in new FDs

### Family Financial Strategy
- Parents (Ashok & Pushpa) use joint accounts
- Son (Dhruv) is nominee on all accounts
- Multiple FDs for risk diversification
- Quarterly interest income: ~₹16,543 combined

### Banking Relationship
- Customer Relation Number: 237964982
- Branch: Lucknow-Aliganj
- Multiple account types (savings, FD)
- Integrated with other banks (transfers to ICICI visible)
