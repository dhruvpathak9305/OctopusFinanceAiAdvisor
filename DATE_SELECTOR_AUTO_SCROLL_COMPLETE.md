# Date Selector Auto-Scroll Implementation - Complete ✅

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Successfully Implemented

## Overview
Enhanced the date selector component to automatically scroll to the current/selected day, month, and year when the modal opens, making them immediately visible without manual scrolling.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Scroll Functionality** ✅

**File**: `src/mobile/components/DateSelectorWithNavigation.tsx`

#### Added ScrollView Refs
```typescript
// Refs for ScrollViews to enable auto-scrolling
const dayScrollRef = useRef<ScrollView>(null);
const monthScrollRef = useRef<ScrollView>(null);
const yearScrollRef = useRef<ScrollView>(null);
```

#### Implemented `scrollToSelected()` Function
- Calculates scroll position based on item height (48px)
- Centers the selected item in the visible area
- Uses `setTimeout` to ensure ScrollViews are rendered before scrolling
- Handles day, month, and year scrolling independently
- Calculates year index offset correctly (years array starts 50 years in the past)

```typescript
const scrollToSelected = () => {
  const itemHeight = 48;
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (dayScrollRef.current) {
      dayScrollRef.current.scrollTo({
        y: (selectedDay - 1) * itemHeight - 50,
        animated: true,
      });
    }
    
    if (monthScrollRef.current) {
      monthScrollRef.current.scrollTo({
        y: selectedMonth * itemHeight - 50,
        animated: true,
      });
    }
    
    if (yearScrollRef.current) {
      const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
      const yearIndex = selectedYear - (currentYear - 50);
      yearScrollRef.current.scrollTo({
        y: yearIndex * itemHeight - 50,
        animated: true,
      });
    }
  }, 100);
};
```

#### Updated `handleOpen()` Function
- Now calls `scrollToSelected()` after setting the modal visible
- Ensures scrolling happens every time the modal is opened

#### Added Auto-Scroll on Mode Change
- Added `useEffect` to trigger scrolling when picker mode changes
- Ensures selected values are always visible when switching between Date/Month/Year modes

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isVisible) {
    scrollToSelected();
  }
}, [pickerMode, isVisible]);
```

#### Attached Refs to ScrollViews
- Day ScrollView: `ref={dayScrollRef}`
- Month ScrollView: `ref={monthScrollRef}`
- Year ScrollView: `ref={yearScrollRef}`

### 2. **Previous Enhancement (Already Implemented)**
- Month names display on single line with `numberOfLines={1}` and `adjustsFontSizeToFit`
- Default selection set to current day, month, and year

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Modal opened with random scroll position
- User had to manually scroll to find current date
- Poor UX for quickly selecting current or nearby dates

### After
- ✅ Modal opens with current/selected values centered in view
- ✅ No manual scrolling needed to see current date
- ✅ Smooth animated scrolling to selected position
- ✅ Auto-scrolls when switching between Date/Month/Year modes
- ✅ Selected values (October 2025) are highlighted and immediately visible

## Technical Details

### Item Height Calculation
- Each picker item: **48px total**
  - `paddingVertical: 12px` (24px total)
  - `fontSize: 16px`
  - `marginVertical: 2px` (4px total)
  - ~4px for text height beyond fontSize

### Scroll Offset
- Offset: `-50px` to center items in the visible area
- Prevents selected item from being at the very top of the ScrollView

### Animation
- Smooth scrolling with `animated: true`
- 100ms delay to ensure DOM is ready

### Mode-Based Scrolling
- Date mode: Scrolls Day, Month, Year columns
- Month mode: Scrolls Month and Year columns only
- Year mode: Scrolls Year column only

## Testing Performed
✅ Modal opens with current date visible and highlighted  
✅ Switching between Date/Month/Year modes auto-scrolls correctly  
✅ Previous/Next month navigation works properly  
✅ Manual date selection updates scroll position  
✅ No linter errors  
✅ Smooth animations in both light and dark themes  

## Files Modified
1. `src/mobile/components/DateSelectorWithNavigation.tsx`
   - Added `useRef` import
   - Created refs for ScrollViews
   - Implemented `scrollToSelected()` function
   - Updated `handleOpen()` to trigger auto-scroll
   - Added `useEffect` for mode-change scrolling
   - Attached refs to all three ScrollViews

## Status
✅ **Complete** - Date selector now auto-scrolls to show current/selected values when opened!

**Result**: Users can now immediately see their selected date (or current date by default) when opening the date picker, with no manual scrolling required. The experience matches the screenshot provided by the user.
