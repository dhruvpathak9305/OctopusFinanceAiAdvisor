## 🛡️ Duplicate Prevention Mechanism

### How It Works

The duplicate detection function uses **three layers** of protection:

1. **Transaction Hash** (Primary)
   - Generated from: user_id + account_id + date + amount + description + reference
   - Most reliable method

2. **Bank Reference Match** (Secondary) ✅ **ACTIVE FOR THESE TRANSFERS**
   - Checks: `bank_reference_number`, `upi_reference_number`, `neft_reference_number`
   - **This is what will prevent duplicates for HDFC/Axis uploads**
   - Each transfer has unique UPI reference stored

3. **Fuzzy Match** (Tertiary)
   - Checks: date + amount + similar description
   - Backup method if references don't match

### Why It Will Work

✅ **All transfers have unique UPI references stored**
- HDFC Transfer: `AXIUP399887887`
- Axis Transfer 1: `AXIUP334982050`
- Axis Transfer 2: `AXIUP289628872`

✅ **When HDFC/Axis statements are uploaded:**
- Same transaction will appear with same UPI reference
- Duplicate detection will catch it using bank reference match
- Transaction will be skipped automatically
- No manual intervention needed
