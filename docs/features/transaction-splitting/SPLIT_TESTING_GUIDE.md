## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Equal Split (2 People)

**Scenario:** You and one friend splitting a ₹1000 dinner bill equally.

**Steps:**
1. Open the app and tap the **+ (plus)** button
2. Fill in transaction details:
   - **Description**: "Dinner at Restaurant"
   - **Amount**: 1000
   - **Account**: Select any account (e.g., IDFC)
   - **Category**: Food & Dining
3. Toggle **Split** to enable splitting
4. Select **Individual** split type
5. Add participant:
   - **Name**: Friend's Name
   - **Email**: friend@gmail.com
   - **Mobile**: 9876543210
   - **Relationship**: Friend
6. System should auto-calculate:
   - Your share: ₹500.00
   - Friend's share: ₹500.00
7. Verify validation shows ✓ (green checkmark)
8. Tap **Add Transaction**
9. Verify success message appears

**Expected Database Result:**
- 1 record in `transactions_real` with amount = 1000
- 2 records in `transaction_splits`:
  - Split 1: your share (₹500, is_paid=true)
  - Split 2: friend's share (₹500, is_paid=false, guest fields populated)

### Test 2: 3-Way Split with Rounding

**Scenario:** You, Shivam, and Yash splitting ₹1000 equally (tests rounding).

**Steps:**
1. Create new transaction:
   - **Description**: "Shared Groceries"
   - **Amount**: 1000
2. Enable **Split**
3. Select **Individual** and add 2 participants:
   - **Shivam**: shivam@gmail.com, 9123456789, Friend
   - **Yash**: yash@gmail.com, 9987654321, Friend
4. Expected split calculation:
   - Your share: ₹333.33
   - Shivam's share: ₹333.33
   - Yash's share: ₹333.34 (extra paisa for rounding)
5. Verify validation shows ✓ or minor warning about rounding
6. Add transaction

**Expected Database Result:**
- 1 transaction with 3 splits
- Total splits = ₹1000.00 (exactly)
- Guest user data (mobile, relationship) saved for Shivam and Yash

### Test 3: GOB Group Split (Society Maintenance)

**Scenario:** Splitting ₹5535.9 society maintenance equally among you, Shivam, and Yash.

**Steps:**
1. **Create Group** (if not already created):
   - Tap **+** → **Split** → **Group** → **Create Group**
   - **Group Name**: "GOB"
   - **Add Members**:
     - Shivam: shivam@gmail.com, 9123456789, Friend
     - Yash: yash@gmail.com, 9987654321, Friend
   - Save group

2. **Create Split Transaction**:
   - **Description**: "Society Maintenance - MyGate"
   - **Amount**: 5535.9
   - **Account**: IDFC
   - **Category**: Housing
3. Enable **Split**
4. Select **Group** → Select **GOB**
5. System should auto-split equally:
   - Your share: ₹1845.30
   - Shivam's share: ₹1845.30
   - Yash's share: ₹1845.30
   - (Total: ₹5535.90)
6. Verify validation passes
7. Add transaction

**Expected Database Result:**
```sql
-- 1 transaction record
SELECT * FROM transactions_real 
WHERE name = 'Society Maintenance - MyGate';
-- Should show: amount = 5535.9, metadata contains "has_splits": true

-- 3 split records
SELECT 
  guest_name,
  guest_email,
  guest_mobile,
  guest_relationship,
  share_amount,
  is_paid
FROM transaction_splits 
WHERE transaction_id = '<transaction_id>';

-- Should show:
-- You: share=1845.30, is_paid=true, guest fields NULL
-- Shivam: share=1845.30, is_paid=false, mobile populated
-- Yash: share=1845.30, is_paid=false, mobile populated
```

---

### Test 4: Verify Guest User Data Persistence

**Query to check database:**
```sql
-- Check if mobile numbers and relationships are saved
SELECT 
  ts.guest_name,
  ts.guest_email,
  ts.guest_mobile,
  ts.guest_relationship,
  ts.share_amount,
  ts.is_paid,
  ts.is_guest_user,
  t.name as transaction_name,
  t.amount as transaction_amount
FROM transaction_splits ts
JOIN transactions_real t ON ts.transaction_id = t.id
WHERE ts.is_guest_user = true
ORDER BY ts.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected Result:**
- All guest splits should have:
  - `is_guest_user = true`
  - `guest_name` populated
  - `guest_email` populated
  - `guest_mobile` populated (if entered during group member creation)
  - `guest_relationship` populated (if entered)

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After each test, verify:

- [ ] Transaction appears in transaction list
- [ ] Transaction shows split indicator/badge
- [ ] Clicking transaction shows split details
- [ ] All participant names visible
- [ ] All amounts add up correctly
- [ ] Guest user data (mobile, relationship) saved correctly
- [ ] No errors in console logs
- [ ] UI remains responsive

---

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Validation Error "Amounts Don't Match"
**Cause:** Rounding errors in split calculations
**Fix:** Ensure the last participant gets the rounding difference

### Issue 2: Guest Fields Not Saved
**Cause:** `handleSplitChange` not enriching data properly
**Fix:** Check that group members have mobile/relationship filled in

### Issue 3: Split Toggle Not Working
**Cause:** ExpenseSplittingInterface component not rendering
**Fix:** Ensure transaction amount is entered first

### Issue 4: Cannot Select Group
**Cause:** Group has no members
**Fix:** Add at least one member to the group before using it

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

All tests are successful if:

1. ✅ All transactions create exactly 1 record in `transactions_real`
2. ✅ Each transaction creates N records in `transaction_splits` (N = number of participants)
3. ✅ Split amounts always sum to transaction amount (within 0.01 tolerance)
4. ✅ Guest user data (mobile, relationship) persists correctly
5. ✅ UI validation works correctly and prevents invalid submissions
6. ✅ Success messages appear after transaction creation
7. ✅ No console errors during any operation

## 📊 Quick DB Verification Queries

### Count Split Transactions
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM transactions_real 
WHERE metadata->>'has_splits' = 'true';
```

### View All Splits Summary
```sql
SELECT 
  t.name,
  t.amount,
  COUNT(ts.id) as split_count,
  SUM(ts.share_amount) as total_shares
FROM transactions_real t
JOIN transaction_splits ts ON t.id = ts.transaction_id
WHERE t.metadata->>'has_splits' = 'true'
GROUP BY t.id, t.name, t.amount
ORDER BY t.date DESC;
```

### Check for Split Inconsistencies
```sql
SELECT 
  t.id,
  t.name,
  t.amount as transaction_amount,
  SUM(ts.share_amount) as split_total,
  t.amount - SUM(ts.share_amount) as difference
FROM transactions_real t
JOIN transaction_splits ts ON t.id = ts.transaction_id
GROUP BY t.id
HAVING ABS(t.amount - SUM(ts.share_amount)) > 0.01;
```
