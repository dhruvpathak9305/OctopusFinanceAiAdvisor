## Usage

To use the `useFetchTransactions` hook, import it into your component and call it with the desired filter options:

```tsx
import { useFetchTransactions } from '@/hooks/useFetchTransactions';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { transactions, groupedTransactions, loading, error, refreshTransactions } = useFetchTransactions({ dateRange: 'month', limit: 50 });

  // Component logic here
};
```

## Expanded Usage Example

```tsx
import { useFetchTransactions } from '@/hooks/useFetchTransactions';

const TransactionsComponent = () => {
  const { transactions, groupedTransactions, loading, error, refreshTransactions } = useFetchTransactions({ dateRange: 'custom', startDate: '2023-01-01', endDate: '2023-12-31', type: 'expense' });

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {Object.entries(groupedTransactions).map(([date, group]) => (
        <div key={date}>
          <h3>{date}</h3>
          <p>Income: ${group.income}</p>
          <p>Expense: ${group.expense}</p>
          <p>Transfer: ${group.transfer}</p>
          <div>
            {group.transactions.map(transaction => (
              <div key={transaction.id}>
                <span>{transaction.name}: ${transaction.amount}</span>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## API

- **transactions**: An array of transactions.
- **groupedTransactions**: Transactions grouped by date and type.
- **loading**: A boolean indicating if the data is currently being fetched.
- **error**: A string containing any error message encountered during operations.
- **refreshTransactions**: A function to manually refresh the list of transactions.

## Error Handling

Errors encountered during operations are handled gracefully, with error messages providing feedback to the user.

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Filtering**: Use specific filters to limit the amount of data fetched, improving performance and reducing load times.
- **Batch Updates**: Consider batching updates to transactions to minimize database calls and enhance performance.

## Advanced Usage

- **Custom Hooks**: Create custom hooks that wrap `useFetchTransactions` to add additional logic or combine it with other hooks for more complex use cases.
- **Integration with Analytics**: Use the grouped transaction data to feed into analytics tools or dashboards for deeper insights into financial trends.
