---

## Manual Verification Queries

If you want to manually verify after upload:

### Check Total Kotak Transactions
```sql
SELECT 
    a.name,
    COUNT(t.id) as transaction_count,
    MAX(t.date) as last_transaction
FROM accounts a
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON (t.source_account_id = a.id OR t.destination_account_id = a.id)
WHERE a.account_number IN ('3712733310', '7246166101')
GROUP BY a.id, a.name;
```

### Check Balances
```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    account_number,
    current_balance,
    institution
FROM accounts
WHERE account_number IN ('3712733310', '7246166101');
```

### Check Recent Transactions
```sql
SELECT 
    t.date,
    t.name,
    t.type,
    t.amount,
    a.name as account
FROM transactions t
JOIN accounts a ON (t.source_account_id = a.id OR t.destination_account_id = a.id)
WHERE a.account_number IN ('3712733310', '7246166101')
  AND t.date >= '2025-07-22'
ORDER BY t.date DESC;
```

---

## Duplicate Prevention

The script uses `bulk_insert_transactions_with_duplicate_check()`:
- âœ… Safe to run multiple times
- âœ… Automatically skips duplicates based on bank reference number
- âœ… Reports what was inserted vs. skipped

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Account not found"
**Solution:** Verify account IDs match in `ACCOUNT_MAPPING.json`:
```json
{
  "account_id": "db0683f0-4a26-45bf-8943-98755f6f7aa2",
  "account_number": "3712733310"
},
{
  "account_id": "f288c939-4ba1-4bd4-abd0-31951e19ee08",
  "account_number": "7246166101"
}
```

### Issue: "User not found"
**Solution:** Update user_id in script line 30:
```sql
\set user_id 'your-actual-user-id'
```

### Issue: "Function does not exist"
**Solution:** Ensure database functions are deployed:
```bash
psql -f database/functions/bulk-insert-transactions.sql
```

### Issue: Balances don't match
**Solution:** Check if there are existing transactions in the date range that might affect balance calculations.

## Post-Upload Actions

After successful upload:

### 1. Update Account Balances (if needed)
```sql
UPDATE accounts 
SET current_balance = 51723.74,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'db0683f0-4a26-45bf-8943-98755f6f7aa2'; -- Account 3712733310

UPDATE accounts 
SET current_balance = 16250.24,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'f288c939-4ba1-4bd4-abd0-31951e19ee08'; -- Account 7246166101
```

### 2. Verify in Application
- Open your finance app
- Navigate to Accounts section
